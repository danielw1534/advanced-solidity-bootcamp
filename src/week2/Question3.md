## Revisit the solidity events tutorial. How can OpenSea quickly determine which NFTs an address owns if most NFTs donâ€™t use ERC721 enumerable? Explain how you would accomplish this if you were creating an NFT marketplace

You would query every block to get a historical list (that's updated with each new block) for all ERC721 contracts created and ERC1155's. Then, you listen for `Transfer` events for any contracts you've already previously indexed. You need to keep this in a centralized database or else query time will be too long.
